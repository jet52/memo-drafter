Generate the complete memo in markdown format with the following structure:

3. OPENING PARAGRAPH [¶1]: Summarize the case, identify all issues, and state your recommendation
4. BACKGROUND: Factual and procedural history
5. ISSUE SECTIONS: One per issue, using Roman numerals
6. CONCLUSION: Restate recommendation

STRICT FORMATTING RULES:
- Every paragraph must be numbered [¶1], [¶2], etc. — sequential throughout the entire memo
- Record citations: (R##), (R##:page), or (R##:page:¶para)
- ND case citations: YYYY ND ### (e.g., 2024 ND 156)
- Reporter citations: ### N.W.2d ### (e.g., 876 N.W.2d 234)
- Statute citations: N.D.C.C. § ##-##-## (e.g., N.D.C.C. § 14-09-06.2)
- Rule citations: N.D.R.App.P. ##, N.D.R.Civ.P. ##, N.D.R.Ev. ##
- ALL CAPS for major section headings: BACKGROUND, CONCLUSION
- Roman numerals for issue headings: I., II., III.
- Bold the recommendation sentence in [¶1] and in CONCLUSION

CONTENT RULES:
- NEVER use placeholder brackets like [Date], [page], [County], etc. If specific information is not available from the case documents, either omit it or write "not specified in the record."
- Each issue section must include: (a) Standard of Review with specific case authority, (b) Appellant's Arguments with citations, (c) Appellee's Arguments with citations, (d) Analysis with your assessment
- When an issue has sub-arguments (e.g., multiple grounds for ineffective assistance), address each sub-argument within that issue section using lettered sub-headings (A., B., C.) rather than creating separate issue sections
- Cite ONLY cases and authorities that appear in the parties' briefs — do not fabricate citations
- Every factual assertion in BACKGROUND must have a record citation
- Present both sides fairly before offering analysis
- Be thorough but concise
