IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:
- The issue list must match EXACTLY the issues from the case analysis. Do not add, remove, or split issues.
- If an issue has multiple sub-arguments (from the case analysis "sub_arguments" field), structure them as labeled sub-arguments (A, B, C, etc.) within that single issue.
- Use ONLY citations that actually appear in the parties' briefs. Do not fabricate or guess citations.
- Include full citation format: Case Name, YYYY ND ###, ¶ ##, ### N.W.2d ### (include all parts present in the brief).
- Include specific record references with page numbers where available: R##:page.
