IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:
- CONSOLIDATE overlapping issues. If the appellant raises multiple sub-arguments under the same legal theory (e.g., multiple instances of ineffective assistance of counsel), group them as sub-points under ONE issue using the "sub_arguments" field. For example, "failure to investigate surveillance video," "failure to investigate alternative suspects," and "failure to challenge 404(b) evidence" should all be sub-arguments under a single "ineffective assistance of counsel" issue.
- Each DISTINCT legal theory or constitutional claim should be its own issue.
- Extract the ACTUAL case number from the documents (look at captions, headers, notice of appeal).
- Extract exact record citations (R##) wherever available. Include page and paragraph where available: (R##:page) or (R##:page:¶para).
- For key_facts, include the record citation for each fact.
- For key_documents, list the most important documents for judicial review.
- Do NOT use placeholder brackets like [Date] or [page]. If information is not available, use null.
